# MHE Analysis
This directory contains Python Jupyter notebooks and example CT data showing the binarization and segmentation of CT data. Example data is a subset of a CT scan performed by Yeager et al. at Los Alamos National Lab (LANL). 

The CT data exists as of 2D, 16-bit `.tif` images showing the reconstruction of the CT scan slice by slice. In these image slices, idox crystals are seen in a binder material. The overarching goal is to develop a procedure for segmentation procedure that will segment the IDOX crystals from each other and from the binder material, but for now, notebooks are provided that achieve imperfect segmentation as a starting point for the modeling groups.
